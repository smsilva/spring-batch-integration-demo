# Spring Integration and Batch Demo

This project is a demo of Spring Integration and Spring Batch.

## Spring Integration

Spring Integration is a framework for enterprise integration. It is based on the well-known Enterprise Integration Patterns (EIP) book by Gregor Hohpe and Bobby Woolf. It provides a set of components for messaging, routing, transformation, and integration with external systems.

## Spring Batch

Spring Batch is a framework for batch processing. It provides reusable functions that are essential in processing large volumes of records, including logging/tracing, transaction management, job processing statistics, job restart, skip, and resource management. It also provides more advanced technical services and features that will enable extremely high-volume and high performance batch jobs through optimization and partitioning techniques. Simple as well as complex, high-volume batch jobs can leverage the framework in a highly scalable manner to process significant volumes of information.
